Espresso was originally known as "Ubuntu Express", which is written and
maintained by Javier Carranza <javier.carranza@interactors.coop> and Juanje
Ojeda Croissier <juanje@interactors.coop>. This version draws heavily on the
work done on Ubuntu Express, but was renamed to avoid confusion, to reduce
awkward branding considerations, and because Espresso concentrates on
reusing debian-installer code and reducing duplicated translation and
branding work as much as possible.
