  * Make acquire_lock properly atomic (LP: #90391).
  * New partitioner: Remove the disk bar placeholder in UIs; we'll probably
    have to do without the disk bar for Feisty at this point.
  * KDE frontend: Fix disk selection handling in automatic partitioner so
    that we stop always selecting the last disk no matter what (LP: #83010).

  * Handle spaces in usernames in migration-assistant. (LP: #89009)
  * Fixed list movement bugs on the Migration page.  Also, selecting an
    item now selects the user as well.  (LP: #89414)
  * The Migration page now auto-fills the username box, matching the
    behavior on the User Setup page. (LP: #89522)
  * Stopped the username auto fill on User Setup from clobbering the m-a
    username.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * GTK frontend:
    - Don't reset partition_edit_mount_combo's cell renderer; doing so
      causes GTK warnings.
    - Add more space around text in question dialogs.
  * New partitioner: Allow changing the mount point for NTFS (LP: #90276).
  * Automatically unmount mounted partitions if they are on a changed
    partition table or they are to be mounted somewhere other than /media/*.
    Display an error and allow the user to try to unmount them manually if
    automatic unmounting fails (LP: #89605).
  * Work around datetime misbehaviour if the system clock is set before the
    Unix epoch (LP: #57952).
  * Add XS-Vcs-Bzr field to debian/control.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup 1.13ubuntu7,
    localechooser 1.37ubuntu1, migration-assistant 0.4.1, partman-auto
    62ubuntu6, partman-base 100ubuntu7, partman-efi 11ubuntu3.

  * Enable migration-assistant by default. Replace --migration-assistant
    option with --no-migration-assistant.
  * Add a console-setup-apply script rather than hacking console-setup's
    post-base-installer script (which is being renamed and changed in ways
    that aren't appropriate for ubiquity).
  * Make sure we never try to remove the kernel package corresponding to the
    running kernel (LP: #86427).

    - Fix edit dialog not to try to resize partitions even if the resize
      spinbutton was left untouched (LP: #85227).
    - Add contextual buttons to GTK frontend (part of LP: #83166).
    - Add an undo facility.
    - partman-* updates add validation support (LP: #82768); also add
      XFS-on-/boot validation.
    - Break out of setting the mountpoint if it's invalid (LP: #84543).
  * Fix crash if multiple newworld boot partitions are present (LP: #84429).
  * GTK frontend:
    - Fix backup from user information page if migration-assistant is not
      active (LP: #85642).
    - Fix up step numbers if migration-assistant is disabled (LP: #85711).
    - Disable smooth zooming, as some video drivers are very slow at drawing
      this and it's hard to handle this dynamically (LP: #67572).
  * Fill in a default username based on the user's full name (LP: #84550).
  * Retranslate Forward button when going back from summary page
    (LP: #86047).

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * New partitioner: Don't allow creating a disk label or creating, editing,
    or deleting a partition while other similar operations are in progress.
  * Display a warning message next to the password entry box if running in
    debug mode, since the password will then end up in the log file via
    debconf debugging.
  * Don't crash if /etc/X11/xorg.conf is unaccountably missing (LP: #83927).
  * Import translations for Cancel, Back, Forward etc. buttons from gtk+2.0
    2.10.9-0ubuntu1 (LP: #43915).
  * Automatic update of included source packages: apt-setup 1:0.16ubuntu3,
    migration-assistant 0.3.1, partman-auto 62ubuntu4,
    partman-basicfilesystems 51ubuntu1.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Merged in migration-assistant work. Moved the user-setup page to after
    migration-assistant (and thus also after the partitioner, since
    migration-assistant needs to know which partitions are to be left
    intact). Made user-setup able to make use of users from
    migration-assistant.

ubiquity (1.3.18) feisty; urgency=low

  * New partitioner:
    - Disable the mountpoint combo box when creating or editing a partition
      if the method is changed to something other than a filesystem.
    - Handle partman/exception_handler and partman/exception_handler_note
      (LP: #82848).
    - Note that unadorned sizes are assumed to be in megabytes (LP: #82848).
    - Display current partition sizes in megabytes (part of LP: #83166).
    - Implement resizing. Ask for the size using a spinbutton (in megabytes)
      rather than a text entry field.
    - Offer 'fat16' and 'fat32' filesystem types for new partitions rather
      than the non-existent 'fat' (LP: #83211).
    - Fix crash when backing up to automatic partitioning page (LP: #83230).
  * doc/README: Add comment about language pack installation following a
    query from Telmo Baía.
  * Fix crash due to underqualification of debconf.DebconfError (thanks,
    Joel Bryan Juliano; LP: #83008).

    method nor mountpoint changed.
  * GTK frontend: Fix re-raising of exceptions to (a) work and (b) interact
    properly with apport's Python hook.
  * Quick hack to avoid updating the initramfs when calling
    console-setup.postinst from within ubiquity.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  1 Feb 2007 00:17:10 +0000

ubiquity (1.3.15) feisty; urgency=low

  * Add --old-partitioner command-line option to force the use of the old
    advanced partitioner even when it stops being the default. (Of course,
    this won't work for ever, as the old code will eventually be removed.)
  * GTK frontend: Disable gnome-volume-manager automounting for the entire
    duration of installation (LP: #78862).
  * Really install the apport hook.
  * Switch the new partitioner on by default. As above, use 'ubiquity
    --old-partitioner' to disable it.

  * New partitioner: Indent partition names two spaces to the right of disk
    names.
  * GTK frontend: Drop privileges while invoking gconftool-2, and point it
    at the correct user's gconf directory; this fixes incorrect automounting
    during partitioning.
  * Fix language pack installation to clean up any broken packages in the
    dependency cache more comprehensively (LP: #61912 and probably a slew of

  * Automatic update of included source packages: console-setup 1.13ubuntu4.

    after installation.
  * Fix a silly typo while setting up the resize progress bar (LP: #77523).
  * Don't say "beta version" in the alpha intro message.
  * Move language list box to the left-hand side of its page rather than the
    bottom, on the basis that you have to choose a language before you can
    read the text.
  * Switch to glade-3 (those with branches that modify ubiquity.glade, take
    note).
  * Add special cases to restore correct handling of Chinese and Portuguese
    language codes.
  * If /cdrom/.disk/release_notes_url is present, display a link to the
    release notes on the language page. See doc/README for the format
    (https://blueprints.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+spec/ubiquity-release-notes).
  * Remove no-longer-canonical /distros from Launchpad URLs.
  * Sync up hostname handling with netcfg; it now allows hostnames between 2
    and 63 characters in length, forbids them starting or ending with a
    hyphen, and interprets hostnames containing dots as hostname.domain and
    adjusts /etc/hosts accordingly (LP: #52501, #72909).

ubiquity (1.3.6) feisty; urgency=low

  * Avoid use of super() in components, since it's far too confusing.
  * I managed to create two different PartmanAuto.error() methods by
    mistake. Merge them.
  * GTK frontend: If a question asked by a component doesn't have a message
    for the dialog body, set it to the title as that's better than nothing.
  * GTK frontend: First cut at the new advanced partitioner. The graphical
    disk view isn't implemented yet, many features are missing, validation
    probably doesn't work properly, and it's very slow, but I hope all these
    issues can be worked out in time. Use 'ubiquity --new-partitioner' to
    try it out.

ubiquity (1.3.5) feisty; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Move the ubiquity executable proper into /usr/lib/ubiquity/bin, and add
    a /usr/bin/ubiquity wrapper that calls gksudo, kdesu, etc. as
    appropriate. This makes argument handling more straightforward and
    reduces the need for strange environment variables.
  * Add command-line option handling: --debug is equivalent to the old
    UBIQUITY_DEBUG environment variable, while --cdebconf is new (and
    experimental). Combined with the above change, this means that the
    clumsy and frontend-dependent 'gksudo env UBIQUITY_DEBUG=1 ubiquity' or
    'kdesu --nonewdcop env UBIQUITY_DEBUG=1 ubiquity' invocations can be
    replaced with just 'ubiquity --debug'.
  * Automatic update of included source packages: choose-mirror 2.10ubuntu1.

  * Run partman-commit while generating the installation summary to make
    sure that we have a partitioning summary even for manual partitioning

    past the confirmation question.
  * Don't reset the locale or run localechooser again if the country
    selected on the timezone page isn't one for which we have a locale in

  * Forbid going back or forward when the UI is already processing a
    previous back or forward action (closes: Malone #54163 and lots of
    duplicates).
  * GTK frontend: Disable back and forward buttons while gparted is starting
    up. Requires gparted (>= 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu11).
  * GTK frontend: Avoid calling gtk.main_quit if a main loop isn't running,
    as further insurance against Malone #54163.

  * Build-depend on po-debconf (>= 1.0) for new translation-handling
    features.
  * Add a FAQ about backporting to doc/README.
  * Document ubiquity/install/filesystem-images in doc/README.
  * autogen.sh: Force use of automake-1.8 and aclocal-1.8.
  * Move auxiliary autotools files to a build subdirectory.
  * Add a check to debian/rules to remind me to bump the version number in
    configure.ac.
  * Read partition flags from gparted (>= 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu9). Display an
    error on the mountpoints page if running on powerpc and there is no HFS
    partition with the boot flag set. Treat HFS partitions with the boot
    flag set as NewWorld bootstrap partitions (closes: Malone #43768).
  * GTK frontend: Add a keyboard variant selector (closes: Malone #61729).
    (The same needs to be done for the KDE frontend.)
  * Remove old kbd-chooser component, which won't be usable any more.
  * Send stderr to /var/log/installer/debug if UBIQUITY_DEBUG is set.
  * Send DEBCONF_DEBUG=filter output to stderr, not syslog; it should be
    interleaved with DEBCONF_DEBUG=developer output.
  * GTK frontend: Throw away stderr from gnome-screensaver-command; it
    outputs far too much rubbish and confuses users.
  * KDE frontend: Fix reboot dialog button handling (closes: Malone #62765).
  * Replace the rather jittery time-remaining message while copying files

    points (closes: Malone #56789).
  * Fix timezone component to deal with frontend.get_timezone returning None
    (closes: Malone #42865).
  * Use more sensible default cities for languages with country shortlists
    (i.e. the intended default rather than the first in alphabetical order
    of country code), working around a missing feature in debconf.
  * Pick a sensible default city for countries with multiple zones but no
    explicit default city (closes: Malone #43914).
  * Remove obsolete Recommends: gparted from ubiquity; ubiquity-frontend-gtk
    already depends on it.
  * Feed not-yet-formatted partition state back into gparted when starting
    it up, so that newly-created partitions aren't listed as "unknown" when
    you go back (requires gparted 0.2.5-1.1ubuntu8; closes: Malone #40404).
  * Fix use of gobject.spawn_async in
    gnome-screensaver-command/xscreensaver-command, broken in 1.1.19.
  * Make sure that "Restart now" is the default option on the final dialog
    (closes: Malone #61517).
  * Log warnings in various cases when partitions are ignored on the
    mountpoints page.
  * GTK frontend: For some reason GtkTable doesn't seem to queue a resize
    itself when you attach children to it, so the mountpoints table was
    showing up blank the first time through. Worked around this.

  * Ignore failures from os.utime on directories. I don't know why I get a
    disproportionate number of reports of this failing, but to be honest I
    don't care enough about directory timestamps to investigate.
  * Add trivial pid file locking, allowing ubiquity to exit gracefully if
    you try to run more than one instance of it at once; previously it blew
    up much more spectacularly upon finding that the debconf database was
    locked (closes: Malone #46569).

    still need to add a UI element for the keyboard variant, and
    translations of layout and variant names are missing, but it mostly
    seems to work.
  * Strip Fonts and Keyboard directories from our copy of console-setup;
    they're very large, and not needed since we don't actually build
    console-setup, but just copy a few scripts from it.
  * Add a ubiquity/install/filesystem-images template, which can be

    space-separated images are given, then they will be overlaid using
    unionfs
    (https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/live-cd-stacked-filesystems).

  * Fix misc.ex to use subprocess.call properly rather than smashing
    arguments together and invoking them via the shell.
  * Remove duplicate logging from Install.chrex.
  * Remove /var/log/installer/syslog from all error messages etc., as
    everything goes to /var/log/syslog now. /var/log/syslog is now copied to
    /var/log/installer/syslog on the target system.
  * Automatically set UBIQUITY_NO_GTK or UBIQUITY_NO_KDE to disable building
    frontends as appropriate if tools are missing (pygtk-codegen-2.0 for the
    GTK frontend, kdepyuic for the KDE frontend). This should never happen
    in normal builds, but saves typing when building test versions.
  * Teach DebconfFilter to send escaped replies when CAPB escape is set.
  * Fix substitution variable for full name in ubiquity/summary.
  * I never really understood the whole control flow around the summary
    page, and I wrote it! Take advantage of the partman-commit script added
    in partman-base 90ubuntu4, so that instead we shut down partman, run the
    summary page, and then start it back up to commit changes. The
    PartmanCommit component is now used for both automatic and manual

    having to do coordinated uploads of that package and espresso all the

    (under d-i/source/), build them as part of our build process, and
    include all the components in the espresso binary package. 'debian/rules
    update' can be used to do automatic updates of these copied source
    packages. This should ultimately simplify maintenance work as well as
    making it much easier for third parties to make local changes to this

    Debconf instance to be passed in the constructor.

espresso (0.99.35) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix estimated install copying time. We no longer use cpio to do the
    copying, but instead do the whole thing in-process. This lets us avoid
    buffering issues.
  * Avoid a long pause without any info message while updating apt's indices
    before downloading language packs.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Enlarge primary text in progress windows, per the GNOME HIG.
    - Turn debconf progress dialog into a normal progress window, since it
      doesn't have any buttons.
    - Allow the label above the keyboard test box to wrap.
  * Update translations for most languages from Rosetta.

espresso (0.99.34) dapper; urgency=low

  * GTK frontend:
    - Remove remaining Spanish strings. Make some of these translatable
      using existing strings in partman; the rest will follow later.
    - In manual partitioning, only mark partitions automatically mounted on
      swap, /, /usr, /var, or /boot to be reformatted by default.
    - Honour the desired type of a filesystem newly created in gparted in
      preference to its current detected type.
    - If a newly-created filesystem is selected, disable the Reformat
      checkbox and force it on, as it makes no sense off.
  * Exempt swap from duplicate mountpoint checks (part of Malone #34465).
  * Fix crash when reporting that a partition is too small.
  * Make the estimated install copying time a bit less madly wrong (it was
    estimating based on the total file size rather than the amount left to
    copy), although I think buffering on cpio's stdin is still causing it to
    be pretty badly out most of the time.

    - Only add new mountpoint table rows if all current rows have been
      filled (closes: Malone #34922).
    - Fix widget names in mount point error handling (closes: Malone
      #36154).
    - Cope with the keyboard selector having no row selected.
    - Cope with getting set_keyboard and set_keyboard_choices in either
      order.
    - Change "Format?" to "Reformat?" in mountpoint table.

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Change dependency on espresso-keyboard-setup to espresso-kbd-chooser,
    since that component moved to another package with a lower version
    number and we don't like epochs.
  * Make the keyboard selector work somewhat sanely -- call back to
    kbd-chooser when the selection is changed.
  * Fix choices_display_map to work correctly and map to the other value
    instead of being an identity map.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Update Portuguese translation from Rosetta.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Prevent gnome-screensaver from kicking in while Espresso is running
      (closes: Malone #34510 espresso-frontend-gtk task).
    - Translate window title immediately when changing language.
    - Make title of install progress bar translatable.
    - Make sure that cancelling the installation at the summary page cancels
      partman too.
    - Make "Installation complete" translatable.
  * Make sure that debconffilter never tries to call the same widget more
    than once for a single command.
  * Move more frontend-independent translation logic from the GTK frontend
    to espresso.misc so that other frontends can use it.

  * Add a pile of translations (only about two per language, but better than
    nothing) taken from elsewhere in the installer.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Fix immediate translation of widgets when changing language.
    - Add a disk selector. Requires partman (>= 78ubuntu1+10).
  * KDE frontend:

  * GTK frontend:
    - Move partitioning committal into the main installation progress bar.
  * Remove text resizing based on the screen size, which as well as being
    annoying was also implemented in a way that made our lives difficult for
    internationalisation.
  * Add internationalisation support for those strings that don't come from
    d-i, with translations stored in debconf templates. I've only set this
    up in the GTK frontend so far, but it should be straightforward to do
    elsewhere. Requires espresso-locale (>= 0.27ubuntu11).
  * Improve the final dialog text.

  * Fix variable/method name clash in Install's apt error handling.
  * GTK frontend:
    - Rename "Adjust..." to "Set Time...".
    - Remove justification text on location page; instead, add brief
      instructions at the top. Rename "Nearest city" to "Selected city".
    - Make the password entry boxes smaller.
    - Change the summary text box to a selectable label so that it gets the
      standard dialog background colour. Add padding around the text.
  * Change permissions of log file in /target to 600 to guard against any
    possible leakage of sensitive data.

  * GTK frontend:
    - Add an "Adjust..." button on the timezone screen which starts
      time-admin to let you change the current time.
  * Make espresso-gtkui.desktop use sudo for now, to work around gksudo
    breakage on the live CD. This means we rely on the live CD having
    passwordless sudo.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * GTK frontend:
    - Set initial Forward button text in glade rather than in code.
    - Change Forward button to say "Install" when on the summary page.
    - Revamp identification page layout. Add callbacks to let user-setup
      tell us about errors on this page more accurately.
  * KDE frontend:
    - Add guesswork/stub implementations for set_fullname(), set_username(),
      username_error(), and password_error(), for use by user-setup.

  [ Daniel Silverstone ]
  * Make sure GTK gparted integration supports the new gparted.

espresso (0.99.26) dapper; urgency=low

  * GTK frontend:
    - Add a test box to the keymap page. (Note that your keymap isn't
      actually changed in the installer at the moment, so this won't work
      yet.)
    - Display the current time in the format used by the currently-selected
      locale.
  * GTK and KDE frontends:
    - Move the keymap page after the location page, so that in future the
      keymap page can be initialised using data for the selected country.
  * Make espresso.tz.SystemTzInfo.dst() pretend that DST is not in effect if
    we have no DST information, rather than returning the more correct None;
    this allows fromutc() to be used reliably.
  * Use espresso-yaboot to install yaboot on powerpc systems.

espresso (0.99.25) dapper; urgency=low

  * GTK frontend:
    - Add a format checkbox to the mountpoints page (closes: Malone #32065).
      Requires partman (>= 78ubuntu1+8).
  * Patched up KDE frontend to avoid breaking it too badly (I hope) until
    corresponding UI is added there too.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  8 Mar 2006 14:59:41 +0000

espresso (0.99.24) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix espresso.tz.SystemTzInfo to work for datetime.datetime.now(tzinfo).
  * GTK frontend:
    - Improve headings and spacing on advanced partitioning pages.
    - Remove more text that claims /home will not be formatted.
    - Rearrange help text on advanced partitioning pages to allow for more
      space on the screen where it matters.
    - Show the current time in the selected timezone on the location page.
    - Translate more strings from Spanish to English.
    - Use HH:MM for UTC offsets rather than fractions of hours.
    - Refer to UTC offsets as GMT offsets instead; it's not quite 100%
      accurate, but (we think) more widely understood.
    - Add a border around the timezone map.
    - Change identification page heading to "Who are you?".
    - Reorganise locale page so that the language select box is in the
      middle rather than at the left-hand side, and shorter.
    - Drop the notebook border.
    - Remove the expander and the "Details" label from the summary page, per
      feedback from the UI sprint.
    - Make the first click on the timezone map zoom in but not select a
      city; the second click will select a city.
  * KDE frontend:
    - Add get_mountpoints method, needed by partman.
  * Remove old Guadalinex screenshots.
  * Remove *.pyc and *.pyo on 'debian/rules clean'.

    option is visible.
  * Fix backup handling in GTK frontend (closes: Malone #32866).

  * Flesh out keymap page, using espresso-keyboard-setup.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Sort presented list of keymaps.
  * Various pychecker-induced cleanups.
  * Make sure that stdout from language pack maintainer scripts doesn't
    interfere with Install's debconf protocol stream, and that a new debconf
    frontend is started for them in the target system.
  * Add set_fullname() and set_username() methods to the GTK frontend for
    use by user-setup.
  * Stop the installation progress bar on all return paths from
    Install.run().
  * Remove packages specific to the live CD after installation (relies on
    having a desktop manifest for the live filesystem from the buildd, which
    isn't done yet). Record packages that are dynamically installed and make
    sure we don't remove those.

    steps into one, called simply Install.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 28 Feb 2006 14:34:44 +0000

espresso (0.99.18) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rip all the /target unmounting code out of espresso.backend.copy and do
    it in the main espresso program just before exiting.
  * Parse /proc/mounts for mountpoints to unmount; this saves having to have
    a get_mountpoints method in every frontend.
  * Unmount /target before starting the frontend, since we will behave badly
    if /target is still mounted from a previous installation attempt.

  * Handle all PROGRESS commands entirely in debconffilter, without passing
    them through to the debconf frontend.
  * Add a PROGRESS REGION extension to debconffilter, and a ProgressPosition
    class to keep track of progress bar regions; allows a single progress
    bar to be subdivided into pieces for different stages.
  * Hack FilteredCommand.run_command() to execute the command without any
    debconffiltering glue if frontend is None; this allows nested
    FilteredCommands to more or less work.
  * Stop FilteredCommand.error() from running a UI loop; we assume that the
    frontend's error_dialog() method runs synchronously.

  * Move espresso/components/summary to a new scripts directory.
  * Rework copy and configuration progress bars using debconffilter. This
    fixes some responsiveness bugs, allows for localisation, and finally
    unifies all progress bar handling.
  * Add debconf template translation boilerplate.

  * Move call_gparted from espresso.backend.part into the GTK frontend, as
    it's widget-set-dependent. Unhardcode the path to gparted.
  * Remove espresso/backend/, none of which is used any more except by the
    netcloner and noui frontends which are both broken at the moment anyway.
    The frontend/backend division is now between espresso.frontend and
    espresso.components, mediated by debconffilter.

  * Make espresso-frontend-gtk Architecture: any, due to the Evolution map
    widget (closes: Malone #32874).
  * Build Evolution map widget and Python bindings with -fPIC; should fix
    build failure on amd64.
  * Only enable the TimezoneMap.flash_selected_point handler when the
    timezone map is visible.
  * Remove text that claims /home will not be formatted; partly fixes Malone
    #32534.
  * Display an error dialog on GRUB installation failures (closes: Malone
    #32047; grub has been seeded, so this shouldn't generally happen any
    more anyway).
  * Notice and exit on errors from the copy and configuration stages.
  * Run 'make distclean' rather than 'make clean' on 'debian/rules clean'.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 27 Feb 2006 14:22:15 +0000

espresso (0.99.17) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=espresso to espresso-gtkui.desktop (although
    it's useless until we get internationalisation set up properly).
  * Open /var/log/installer/espresso with line-buffering so that error
    messages appear there more quickly during testing.
  * Fix debconffilter to handle SET and SUBST commands whose values consist
    of more than one word.
  * Add a "Ready to install" summary page. (It doesn't contain all the
    necessary information yet, and it should run before partitioning is
    committed rather than after, but that will be easy to fix later.)
  * In the GTK frontend, display an error dialog and exit if running as
    non-root.
  * Restore some bits of autoconfiscation that bzr helped me lose.

  * Explicitly decode strings returned by debconf as UTF-8, since apparently
    we get confused when running with the KDE frontend otherwise (which
    presumably does something funky with Python's default encoding).
  * Rename Changelog to Changelog.Guadalinex to avoid confusion. Ubuntu
    changes (i.e. everything since renaming to espresso) go here.
  * Add e-map widget, cut-and-pasted from evolution via gnome-system-tools
    (ugh).
  * Basic autoconfiscation for the above.
  * Add initial Python bindings for e-map.
  * Add an espresso.tz module for various bits of timezone handling.
  * First cut at timezone map widget, based on a translation of code in
    gnome-system-tools into Python. Depend on espresso-timezone.

espresso (0.99.15) dapper; urgency=low

  * Redirect sys.stderr to /var/log/installer/espresso so that we have a
    better chance of diagnosing problems after the fact.
  * Add FilteredCommand.value_index helper from oem-config.
  * Add support for components optionally returning a third argument from
    FilteredCommand.prepare(), interpreted as a dictionary of extra
    environment variables to set for the subprocess.
  * Add a language page, using espresso-locale. The locale is set in the
    target system and used for debconf coprocesses, although not yet for
    translatable strings in the Espresso core.
  * Add a FilteredCommand.cleanup() hook that can be overridden by
    components to perform cleanup tasks after their subprocess exits.
  * Stop logging every single file we copy to /var/log/installer/espresso;
    it creates massive log bloat and isn't very useful.

espresso (0.99.13) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove the GTK frontend's reliance on step numbers entirely; refer to
    widget names for each step instead. This makes it easier to add steps.
  * Fix the GTK frontend's reboot button.
  * Remove fstab configuration; partman does all this now, and trying to do
    it ourselves breaks in the autopartitioning case.
  * Make sure to block in progress_loop() until the final dialog has
    finished, rather than continuing and (in some cases) trying to re-run
    the partitioner.

  * Use named constants rather than just numbers for the steps in gtkui.py
  * Move the common parts (logo, photo and breadcrumb) outside the

    highlight the correct one.
  * Use named constants instead of just numbers which make inserting new
    steps in the beginning possible.
  * Begin implementing a keyboard selector.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Stop destroying the browser widget; following Tollef's changes, this

  * Hide the disk selector until it becomes useful.
  * More PEP 8 reformatting, this time in espresso.misc.

  * Stop logging how much time was spent in the installation; it makes it
    unnecessarily painful to quit espresso if you try to run it as non-root.
  * Get rid of the confirmation checkbox for automatic partitioning; partman
    pops up a more detailed confirmation dialog for this now.
  * Make ESPRESSO_DEBUG=1 imply DEBCONF_DEBUG='developer|filter' for ease of
    debugging.
  * Stop building espresso-frontend-cloner, espresso-guadalinex-artwork, and
    espresso-guadalinex-doc for now, until they work again and are

espresso (0.99.9) dapper; urgency=low

  * Drop on_key_press handler from GTK frontend; setting has_default on the
    Next button is cleaner, and having both that and a keypress handler
    breaks things.
  * Add a non-blocking mode to debconffilter, and watch the filter's input
    from the GTK main loop. This allows the GTK user interface to update
    while waiting for debconf commands.
  * Log errors from user-setup-apply and grub-installer, although for now
    it's unnecessarily painful to actually display them to the user.
  * Reduce log noise in configuration stage.
  * Try to disable gnome-volume-manager's automounting while mounting
    partitions.
  * Use the new stdio control interface in gparted 0.1-0ubuntu2 to apply
    changes when going forward from the manual partitioning screen, undo
    changes when going backward, and clean up gparted properly in either
    case. Make sure to relaunch gparted when required, as we can now launch

  * Don't display paths while copying the filesystem; it will cause a lot of

espresso (0.99.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rename to espresso to avoid confusion caused by somebody other than
    Ubuntu being upstream for a project called "Ubuntu ...", to reduce
    awkward branding considerations, and to clearly separate the work being
    done on this project for Dapper from the work done by Guadalinex since
    the focus is rather different.
  * Change Maintainer to me.
  * Rename lib directory in source to espresso so that pychecker can be used
    more easily.
  * Log to /var/log/installer/espresso instead of /var/log/<distro>-express.
  * Change all uses of express/* debconf questions to real questions where
    possible, and espresso/* where not.

  * Add debconffilter.py from oem-config (this has been sent to debconf
    upstream and may eventually make it in there instead). We'll use this
    for d-i integration.
  * Adjust debconffilter to filter out STOP.
  * Add generic error question handling, METAGET filtering, SUBST filtering,
    and PROGRESS filtering to debconffilter.
  * Ignore unknown commands in debconffilter, since some programs (hi,
    partman!) use multi-line commands despite them only working in cdebconf
    by fluke.
  * Add debconfcommunicator.py too; it's been committed to debconf upstream,
    but it's useful here anyway for backports to breezy.
  * Add rudimentary FilteredCommand class, a convenience wrapper around
    DebconfFilter that makes it easier to test various things.
  * Add filtered debconf progress bar handling in the GTK frontend.

  * Add apt-install and udpkg compatibility shims.
  * Call user-setup as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    corresponding UI step, replacing our own duplicated validation code.
  * Call partman as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    autopartitioning UI step. Remove peez2 entirely, as this will replace it
    once it's finished.
  * Change gparted invocation to use new --installer=WID option.
  * Replace hand-rolled partition formatting and mounting code with a call
    to PartmanCommit.
  * Copy from /rofs if it exists, rather than hunting through the CD for the
    filesystem image. Requires casper 1.25.
  * Run hook scripts in /usr/lib/espresso/target-config (filenames
    containing '.' are ignored) so that casper can propagate appropriate
    parts of its configuration to the target system.
  * Remove all references to base-config; timezone configuration now
    requires a .deb of the new tzsetup.
  * Use espresso-grub for GRUB installation rather than doing it by hand.
  * Drop dependency on yaboot | grub.

  * Refer to ubuntu.com everywhere, not the deprecated ubuntulinux.org.
  * Don't use full-screen mode.
  * Don't keep the GTK user interface window on top; it's annoying during
    development, and arguable at best in production.
  * Remove the numbers from the breadcrumb trail at the top of the screen.
  * Disable embedded web browser for now since this segfaults in current
    dapper (Bugzilla #20338). For the time being, replace it with a scary
    message telling users to be sure to BACK UP THEIR DATA FIRST.
  * Translate strings in glade file and progress queue messages to English.
    In the unlikely event that any of the strings remain basically
    identical, I'll restore the original text as a Spanish translation.
  * In general, don't send a progress queue message when completing a task,
    only when starting one. There's no point constructing translatable text
    that's only going to be on the screen for tiny fractions of a second
    anyway.
  * Strip newlines from lines in messages.txt.
  * Get rid of almost-useless help button. In general, the UI should be made
    self-explanatory rather than requiring extra clicks to get at help
    information.

  * Fix Config.get_locales() using DebconfCommunicator.
  * Try fetching timezone from /etc/localtime as well as from /etc/timezone.
  * Handle missing keymap and/or locale debconf questions.
  * Fix kernel version detection.
  * Use 'lsb_release -is' rather than reading /etc/lsb-release directly.
  * Depend on lsb-release.
  * Don't preselect a mount point for /home.
  * Fix unmounting at end of installation.
  * Remove ubuntu-express wrapper script; eventually we'll do whatever
    unmounting is necessary during the partitioning step rather than turning
    off swap for the whole installer (and partman should help with this
    already).
  * Install installer script as /usr/bin/espresso rather than
    /usr/bin/installer.
  * Quieten cpio a bit.

  * Use dh_installdocs to install documentation.
  * Remove unnecessary ${shlibs:Depends} dependencies.
  * Fix broken use of debhelper; the author seemed to be confusing -A and
    -a, and in any case we only build architecture-independent packages.
  * Use dh_install instead of verbose code in debian/rules (which includes a
    bashism anyway).
  * Remove hardcoded svn commands in generate-doc.sh.
  * Remove svn exclusion stuff in debian/rules; if building from a
    Subversion checkout, you should use standard workarounds to avoid .svn
    directories.
  * Remove generated source code documentation for now; it's really not
    terribly useful, certainly not in the espresso binary package, and
    ultimately it should be generated as part of the build process if at
    all.
  * Rewrite descriptions to be better English and (I hope) more useful.
