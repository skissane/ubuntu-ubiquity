  * Remove kernels that aren't appropriate for the current system, using
    base-installer's kernel selection logic. This fixes 32-bit powerpc
    systems, which otherwise would try to boot a 64-bit kernel by default.
  * Rephrase all strings that talk about "Ubuntu" so that Kubuntu, Edubuntu,

    installing.

  * Make espresso-frontend-gtk depend on espresso.
  * Reorganise component packaging. Instead of having to modify each d-i
    component to produce an espresso-* binary package (in most cases) and
    having to do coordinated uploads of that package and espresso all the
    time, we now include all the relevant d-i source packages in this one
    (under d-i/source/), build them as part of our build process, and
    include all the components in the espresso binary package. 'debian/rules
    update' can be used to do automatic updates of these copied source
    packages. This should ultimately simplify maintenance work as well as
    making it much easier for third parties to make local changes to this
    installer.
  * All FilteredCommand implementations for components now belong to
    espresso rather than to the component (because they were quite tightly
    bound to espresso's UI frontends anyway) and will be removed from
    component packages.
  * Use debian-installer/dummy template (from debian-installer-utils) for

espresso (0.99.23) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * Add KDE frontend, espresso-frontend-kde

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix lots of file descriptor leaks.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  3 Mar 2006 16:44:09 +0000

espresso (0.99.22) dapper; urgency=low

  * Improve the appearance of several pages a bit.
  * Automatically scroll language and keymap lists so that the selected
    option is visible.
  * Fix backup handling in GTK frontend (closes: Malone #32866).
  * Allow cancelling installation by closing the window (closes: Malone
    #32865).
  * Catch IOError while downloading language packs.
  * Put back get_mountpoints methods in frontends, as partman needs them.

espresso (0.99.21) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Allow prepare() methods in components to have access to the debconf
    database.
  * Add FilteredCommand.choices_display_map helper.
  * Flesh out keymap page, using espresso-keyboard-setup.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Sort presented list of keymaps.
  * Various pychecker-induced cleanups.
  * Make sure that stdout from language pack maintainer scripts doesn't
    interfere with Install's debconf protocol stream, and that a new debconf
    frontend is started for them in the target system.
  * Add set_fullname() and set_username() methods to the GTK frontend for
    use by user-setup.
  * Stop the installation progress bar on all return paths from
    Install.run().
  * Remove packages specific to the live CD after installation (relies on
    having a desktop manifest for the live filesystem from the buildd, which
    isn't done yet). Record packages that are dynamically installed and make
    sure we don't remove those.
  * Depend on python-apt.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  2 Mar 2006 13:33:51 +0000

espresso (0.99.20) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add support for cancellable progress bars.
  * The Copy/Config split is more inconvenient than useful, so merge the two
    steps into one, called simply Install.
  * Install language packs according to the selected language.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed,  1 Mar 2006 14:13:17 +0000

espresso (0.99.19) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Jonathan Riddell ]
  * Add accessor methods to the GTK frontend for use by user-setup.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 28 Feb 2006 14:34:44 +0000

espresso (0.99.18) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rip all the /target unmounting code out of espresso.backend.copy and do
    it in the main espresso program just before exiting.
  * Parse /proc/mounts for mountpoints to unmount; this saves having to have
    a get_mountpoints method in every frontend.
  * Unmount /target before starting the frontend, since we will behave badly
    if /target is still mounted from a previous installation attempt.

  * Handle all PROGRESS commands entirely in debconffilter, without passing
    them through to the debconf frontend.
  * Add a PROGRESS REGION extension to debconffilter, and a ProgressPosition
    class to keep track of progress bar regions; allows a single progress
    bar to be subdivided into pieces for different stages.
  * Hack FilteredCommand.run_command() to execute the command without any
    debconffiltering glue if frontend is None; this allows nested
    FilteredCommands to more or less work.
  * Stop FilteredCommand.error() from running a UI loop; we assume that the
    frontend's error_dialog() method runs synchronously.

  * Move espresso/components/summary to a new scripts directory.
  * Rework copy and configuration progress bars using debconffilter. This
    fixes some responsiveness bugs, allows for localisation, and finally
    unifies all progress bar handling.
  * Add debconf template translation boilerplate.

  * Move call_gparted from espresso.backend.part into the GTK frontend, as
    it's widget-set-dependent. Unhardcode the path to gparted.
  * Remove espresso/backend/, none of which is used any more except by the
    netcloner and noui frontends which are both broken at the moment anyway.
    The frontend/backend division is now between espresso.frontend and
    espresso.components, mediated by debconffilter.

  * Make espresso-frontend-gtk Architecture: any, due to the Evolution map
    widget (closes: Malone #32874).
  * Build Evolution map widget and Python bindings with -fPIC; should fix
    build failure on amd64.
  * Only enable the TimezoneMap.flash_selected_point handler when the
    timezone map is visible.
  * Remove text that claims /home will not be formatted; partly fixes Malone
    #32534.
  * Display an error dialog on GRUB installation failures (closes: Malone
    #32047; grub has been seeded, so this shouldn't generally happen any
    more anyway).
  * Notice and exit on errors from the copy and configuration stages.
  * Run 'make distclean' rather than 'make clean' on 'debian/rules clean'.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 27 Feb 2006 14:22:15 +0000

espresso (0.99.17) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add X-Ubuntu-Gettext-Domain=espresso to espresso-gtkui.desktop (although
    it's useless until we get internationalisation set up properly).
  * Open /var/log/installer/espresso with line-buffering so that error
    messages appear there more quickly during testing.
  * Fix debconffilter to handle SET and SUBST commands whose values consist
    of more than one word.
  * Add a "Ready to install" summary page. (It doesn't contain all the
    necessary information yet, and it should run before partitioning is
    committed rather than after, but that will be easy to fix later.)
  * In the GTK frontend, display an error dialog and exit if running as
    non-root.
  * Restore some bits of autoconfiscation that bzr helped me lose.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 24 Feb 2006 14:44:28 +0000

espresso (0.99.16) dapper; urgency=low

  * Explicitly decode strings returned by debconf as UTF-8, since apparently
    we get confused when running with the KDE frontend otherwise (which
    presumably does something funky with Python's default encoding).
  * Rename Changelog to Changelog.Guadalinex to avoid confusion. Ubuntu
    changes (i.e. everything since renaming to espresso) go here.
  * Add e-map widget, cut-and-pasted from evolution via gnome-system-tools
    (ugh).
  * Basic autoconfiscation for the above.
  * Add initial Python bindings for e-map.
  * Add an espresso.tz module for various bits of timezone handling.
  * First cut at timezone map widget, based on a translation of code in
    gnome-system-tools into Python. Depend on espresso-timezone.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 23 Feb 2006 13:26:13 +0000

espresso (0.99.15) dapper; urgency=low

  * Redirect sys.stderr to /var/log/installer/espresso so that we have a
    better chance of diagnosing problems after the fact.
  * Add FilteredCommand.value_index helper from oem-config.
  * Add support for components optionally returning a third argument from
    FilteredCommand.prepare(), interpreted as a dictionary of extra
    environment variables to set for the subprocess.
  * Add a language page, using espresso-locale. The locale is set in the
    target system and used for debconf coprocesses, although not yet for
    translatable strings in the Espresso core.
  * Add a FilteredCommand.cleanup() hook that can be overridden by
    components to perform cleanup tasks after their subprocess exits.
  * Stop logging every single file we copy to /var/log/installer/espresso;
    it creates massive log bloat and isn't very useful.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 21 Feb 2006 13:12:13 +0000

espresso (0.99.14) dapper; urgency=low

  * Set NoDisplay=true in espresso-gtkui.desktop so that it doesn't show up
    on menus. I may remove this again once we've figured out how to make
    espresso not install itself on the target system.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 17 Feb 2006 18:40:10 +0000

espresso (0.99.13) dapper; urgency=low

  * Remove the GTK frontend's reliance on step numbers entirely; refer to
    widget names for each step instead. This makes it easier to add steps.
  * Fix the GTK frontend's reboot button.
  * Remove fstab configuration; partman does all this now, and trying to do
    it ourselves breaks in the autopartitioning case.
  * Make sure to block in progress_loop() until the final dialog has
    finished, rather than continuing and (in some cases) trying to re-run
    the partitioner.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 17 Feb 2006 18:20:19 +0000

espresso (0.99.12) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Use named constants rather than just numbers for the steps in gtkui.py
  * Move the common parts (logo, photo and breadcrumb) outside the
    notebook so they don't have to be kept in sync.  Adjust code to
    highlight the correct one.
  * Use named constants instead of just numbers which make inserting new
    steps in the beginning possible.
  * Begin implementing a keyboard selector.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Stop destroying the browser widget; following Tollef's changes, this
    changes the number of pages in the notebook, causing much confusion.
  * Use named constants in espresso.validation; construct returned list more
    sensibly.
  * Hide the disk selector until it becomes useful.
  * More PEP 8 reformatting, this time in espresso.misc.
  * Fix 'espresso <frontend-name>' not to try to do two installs.
  * Provide a .desktop file for the GTK frontend.
  * Remove Guadalinex-specific text from warning and abort dialogs.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 15 Feb 2006 23:00:58 +0000

espresso (0.99.11) dapper; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Stop auto-hiding the panel when running the GTK frontend.
  * Stop logging how much time was spent in the installation; it makes it
    unnecessarily painful to quit espresso if you try to run it as non-root.
  * Get rid of the confirmation checkbox for automatic partitioning; partman
    pops up a more detailed confirmation dialog for this now.
  * Make ESPRESSO_DEBUG=1 imply DEBCONF_DEBUG='developer|filter' for ease of
    debugging.
  * Stop building espresso-frontend-cloner, espresso-guadalinex-artwork, and
    espresso-guadalinex-doc for now, until they work again and are
    better-tested.

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * Global reformatting to conform roughly to PEP 8 rather than a mish-mash
    of difficult-to-read styles.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Wed, 15 Feb 2006 12:54:43 +0000

espresso (0.99.10) dapper; urgency=low

  * Move the installation progress bar and the final message to separate
    windows, per https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuExpress/GnomeUserInterface.
  * Remove all the screenshots. We'll replace these with an animated demo
    when that's ready.
  * Avoid broken-image icons if logo or photo images aren't available.
  * Hardcode a list of valid debconf commands in debconffilter and ignore
    any we don't recognise. Works around most problems with multi-line
    commands in partman for now.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 21:58:54 +0000

espresso (0.99.9) dapper; urgency=low

  * Drop on_key_press handler from GTK frontend; setting has_default on the
    Next button is cleaner, and having both that and a keypress handler
    breaks things.
  * Add a non-blocking mode to debconffilter, and watch the filter's input
    from the GTK main loop. This allows the GTK user interface to update
    while waiting for debconf commands.
  * Log errors from user-setup-apply and grub-installer, although for now
    it's unnecessarily painful to actually display them to the user.
  * Reduce log noise in configuration stage.
  * Try to disable gnome-volume-manager's automounting while mounting
    partitions.
  * Use the new stdio control interface in gparted 0.1-0ubuntu2 to apply
    changes when going forward from the manual partitioning screen, undo
    changes when going backward, and clean up gparted properly in either
    case. Make sure to relaunch gparted when required, as we can now launch
    it more than once.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 14 Feb 2006 16:06:00 +0000

espresso (0.99.8) dapper; urgency=low

  * Use new target-config hooks from espresso-casper rather than copying
    xorg.conf and (wrongly) reconfiguring gnome-panel-data ourselves.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri,  3 Feb 2006 16:13:43 +0000

espresso (0.99.7) dapper; urgency=low

  * Refactor FilteredCommand.run_command() into several pieces, leaving a
    wrapper there for convenience.
  * Use new UserSetupApply class from user-setup 0.05ubuntu2.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  2 Feb 2006 22:41:45 +0000

espresso (0.99.6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial work on porting to cdebconf (for speed and for increased
    compatibility with d-i), not enabled by default yet until I've had a
    chance to give it more testing.
  * Don't display paths while copying the filesystem; it will cause a lot of
    flickering when we make the counter update more often, and paths that
    are only updated at semi-random points every few seconds during the
    copying process are more confusing than interesting.
  * Fix apt-install to install packages in /target, not /.
  * Update the GTK interface much more frequently during the copying and
    configuration processes.
  * Fix various focus and default-dialog-action settings in the GTK
    interface.
  * Pad out the text in the debconf progress dialog a bit more.
  * Refactor DebconfFilter.run() into several pieces.
  * Rely on corrected return value from PartmanCommit.run_command().
    Requires partman (>= 78ubuntu1+3).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu,  2 Feb 2006 17:56:29 +0000

espresso (0.99.5) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add get_hostname and get_mountpoints methods to frontends so that
    components can get at them without the nasty vars file hack. Remove all
    code handling the vars file.
  * Build espresso in the binary-arch target. This time I've even tested it.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 31 Jan 2006 20:55:29 +0000

espresso (0.99.4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Make espresso Architecture: any; it has different dependencies on
    different architectures.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 31 Jan 2006 14:31:18 +0000

espresso (0.99.3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix stupid debian/rules thinko affecting powerpc.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 31 Jan 2006 11:06:58 +0000

espresso (0.99.2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix cpio arguments.
  * Drop espresso-yaboot dependency on powerpc for now, until it exists.
  * Drop obsolete dependency on zenity.
  * Convert debconffilter to use subprocess.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 31 Jan 2006 10:48:09 +0000

espresso (0.99.1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Rename to espresso to avoid confusion caused by somebody other than
    Ubuntu being upstream for a project called "Ubuntu ...", to reduce
    awkward branding considerations, and to clearly separate the work being
    done on this project for Dapper from the work done by Guadalinex since
    the focus is rather different.
  * Change Maintainer to me.
  * Rename lib directory in source to espresso so that pychecker can be used
    more easily.
  * Log to /var/log/installer/espresso instead of /var/log/<distro>-express.
  * Change all uses of express/* debconf questions to real questions where
    possible, and espresso/* where not.

  * Add debconffilter.py from oem-config (this has been sent to debconf
    upstream and may eventually make it in there instead). We'll use this
    for d-i integration.
  * Adjust debconffilter to filter out STOP.
  * Add generic error question handling, METAGET filtering, SUBST filtering,
    and PROGRESS filtering to debconffilter.
  * Ignore unknown commands in debconffilter, since some programs (hi,
    partman!) use multi-line commands despite them only working in cdebconf
    by fluke.
  * Add debconfcommunicator.py too; it's been committed to debconf upstream,
    but it's useful here anyway for backports to breezy.
  * Add rudimentary FilteredCommand class, a convenience wrapper around
    DebconfFilter that makes it easier to test various things.
  * Add filtered debconf progress bar handling in the GTK frontend.

  * Add apt-install and udpkg compatibility shims.
  * Call user-setup as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    corresponding UI step, replacing our own duplicated validation code.
  * Call partman as a debconffilter coprocess while running the
    autopartitioning UI step. Remove peez2 entirely, as this will replace it
    once it's finished.
  * Change gparted invocation to use new --installer=WID option.
  * Replace hand-rolled partition formatting and mounting code with a call
    to PartmanCommit.
  * Copy from /rofs if it exists, rather than hunting through the CD for the
    filesystem image. Requires casper 1.25.
  * Run hook scripts in /usr/lib/espresso/target-config (filenames
    containing '.' are ignored) so that casper can propagate appropriate
    parts of its configuration to the target system.
  * Remove all references to base-config; timezone configuration now
    requires a .deb of the new tzsetup.
  * Use espresso-grub for GRUB installation rather than doing it by hand.
  * Drop dependency on yaboot | grub.

  * Refer to ubuntu.com everywhere, not the deprecated ubuntulinux.org.
  * Don't use full-screen mode.
  * Don't keep the GTK user interface window on top; it's annoying during
    development, and arguable at best in production.
  * Remove the numbers from the breadcrumb trail at the top of the screen.
  * Disable embedded web browser for now since this segfaults in current
    dapper (Bugzilla #20338). For the time being, replace it with a scary
    message telling users to be sure to BACK UP THEIR DATA FIRST.
  * Translate strings in glade file and progress queue messages to English.
    In the unlikely event that any of the strings remain basically
    identical, I'll restore the original text as a Spanish translation.
  * In general, don't send a progress queue message when completing a task,
    only when starting one. There's no point constructing translatable text
    that's only going to be on the screen for tiny fractions of a second
    anyway.
  * Strip newlines from lines in messages.txt.
  * Get rid of almost-useless help button. In general, the UI should be made
    self-explanatory rather than requiring extra clicks to get at help
    information.

  * Fix Config.get_locales() using DebconfCommunicator.
  * Try fetching timezone from /etc/localtime as well as from /etc/timezone.
  * Handle missing keymap and/or locale debconf questions.
  * Fix kernel version detection.
  * Use 'lsb_release -is' rather than reading /etc/lsb-release directly.
  * Depend on lsb-release.
  * Don't preselect a mount point for /home.
  * Fix unmounting at end of installation.
  * Remove ubuntu-express wrapper script; eventually we'll do whatever
    unmounting is necessary during the partitioning step rather than turning
    off swap for the whole installer (and partman should help with this
    already).
  * Install installer script as /usr/bin/espresso rather than
    /usr/bin/installer.
  * Quieten cpio a bit.

  * Use dh_installdocs to install documentation.
  * Remove unnecessary ${shlibs:Depends} dependencies.
  * Fix broken use of debhelper; the author seemed to be confusing -A and
    -a, and in any case we only build architecture-independent packages.
  * Use dh_install instead of verbose code in debian/rules (which includes a
    bashism anyway).
  * Remove hardcoded svn commands in generate-doc.sh.
  * Remove svn exclusion stuff in debian/rules; if building from a
    Subversion checkout, you should use standard workarounds to avoid .svn
    directories.
  * Remove generated source code documentation for now; it's really not
    terribly useful, certainly not in the espresso binary package, and
    ultimately it should be generated as part of the build process if at
    all.
  * Rewrite descriptions to be better English and (I hope) more useful.
